```env
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here
PGPORT=5432
PGUSER=your_db_user
PGPASSWORD=your_db_password
PGDATABASE=your_db_name
PGHOST=your_db_host
```

4. Start development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser

## 3. Deployment Options

```bash
vercel
```

3. Follow the prompts to connect your GitHub account
4. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
5. Deploy with: `vercel --prod`

**Benefits:**
- Excellent performance
- Automatic deployments from Git
- Free tier available

### Option 3: Netlify
1. Build your project:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Upload the `dist` folder to Netlify
3. Configure environment variables in Netlify dashboard
4. Set up continuous deployment from Git

### Option 4: Railway
1. Install Railway CLI:
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
```

2. Login and deploy:
```bash
railway login
railway deploy
```

**Benefits:**
- Built-in database support
- Easy environment variable management

### Option 5: Self-Hosted (VPS/Server)
1. Rent a VPS (DigitalOcean, Linode, AWS EC2)
2. Install Node.js and PostgreSQL
3. Upload your code
4. Set up PM2 for process management:
```bash
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start npm --name "portfolio" -- start
```

5. Configure Nginx as reverse proxy
6. Set up SSL with Let's Encrypt

## 4. Database Deployment

### For Replit Deployment
- Database is automatically included and configured

### For Other Platforms
You'll need a PostgreSQL database. Options:

**Hosted Database Services:**
- Neon (neon.tech) - Recommended, has free tier
- Supabase (supabase.com) - Free tier with additional features
- Railway (railway.app) - Simple setup
- AWS RDS - Production-grade
- Heroku Postgres - Easy integration

**Setup Steps:**
1. Create account with chosen provider
2. Create new PostgreSQL database
3. Get connection string
4. Update your environment variables
5. Run database migration:
```bash
npm run db:push
```

## 5. Environment Variables for Production

Create these environment variables in your deployment platform:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL=your_production_database_url
PGPORT=5432
PGUSER=your_production_user
PGPASSWORD=your_production_password
PGDATABASE=your_production_db_name
PGHOST=your_production_host

# Optional: If using external services
NODE_ENV=production
```

## 6. Custom Domain Setup

### For Replit Deployments
1. Go to your deployment dashboard
2. Click "Connect Domain"
3. Enter your domain name
4. Update your domain's DNS settings as instructed

### For Other Platforms
Each platform has specific instructions for custom domains:
- Vercel: Add domain in project settings
- Netlify: Add domain in site settings
- Railway: Configure domain in project dashboard

### DNS Configuration
Point your domain to your deployment:
- **A Record**: Point to IP address (for VPS)
- **CNAME**: Point to platform URL (for hosted services)

## 7. Performance Optimization

### Before Deployment
1. Optimize images (compress, convert to WebP)
2. Remove unused dependencies:
```bash
npm prune --production
```

3. Build optimized version:
```bash
npm run build
```

### After Deployment
1. Set up CDN (Cloudflare, AWS CloudFront)
2. Enable compression (Gzip/Brotli)
3. Configure caching headers
4. Monitor performance with tools like PageSpeed Insights

## 8. Ongoing Maintenance

### Regular Updates
1. Keep dependencies updated:
```bash
npm update
```

2. Monitor for security vulnerabilities:
```bash
npm audit
```

### Backup Strategy
1. Regular database backups
2. Code backups in Git repository
3. Environment variable documentation

### Monitoring
- Set up uptime monitoring (UptimeRobot, Pingdom)
- Monitor database performance
- Track form submissions and errors

## 9. Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Errors
```bash
# Clear node modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Database Connection Issues
- Verify environment variables
- Check database URL format
- Ensure database server is running
- Verify network connectivity

### Deployment Failures
- Check build logs for errors
- Verify all environment variables are set
- Ensure dependencies are properly installed
- Check for missing files in deployment

## 10. Cost Considerations

### Free Tier Options
- **Replit**: Free tier available
- **Vercel**: Generous free tier
- **Netlify**: 100GB bandwidth free
- **Railway**: $5/month after trial
- **Neon**: Free PostgreSQL tier

### Paid Recommendations
- **Small Projects**: Replit Pro ($7/month)
- **Professional**: Vercel Pro ($20/month)
- **Enterprise**: AWS/Google Cloud

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. Test all functionality on live site
2. Set up analytics (Google Analytics, Plausible)
3. Configure contact form notifications
4. Add sitemap.xml for SEO
5. Submit to search engines
6. Share your portfolio URL
